## 🧠 About Me

I’m a Computer Science student at Ain Shams University with a huge passion for building real-world solutions.  
I joined this field because I genuinely love solving logical problems and turning ideas into working code.  
Seeing the result of the effort I invest in coding is one of the most rewarding experiences I could ever have.

In the future, I hope to help people by providing practical and effective solutions to real-life problems, and by developing websites that make everyday tasks easier and more accessible.

## 🛠️ Offered Services

As a beginner developer, I currently build functional console-based applications using C++ and Python.  
I focus on solving real-world problems through code that runs in the terminal.  
While I’m still learning advanced topics like web development and automation, I can:

- Create logic-based scripts and simulations (e.g., Coffee Machine, Car Service Assistant)  
- Build simple programs that take input and produce meaningful output  
- Develop beginner-level projects that reflect problem-solving and structured thinking

I’m working on expanding these skills to offer more advanced services in the near future.

## 🚀 Projects

### 🔹 Coffee Machine (Python)  
A console-based coffee machine simulator where users can select their drink (e.g., espresso, latte). Each drink requires specific ingredients (milk, water, coffee), and the machine checks availability before processing the order and payment.  
> **Key Features:**  
> - Input validation to ensure user provides correct values  
> - Modular design using multiple functions and files  
> - Real-world simulation with resource tracking and payment logic

---

### 🔹 Car Service Center (C++)  
A system that allows users to enter their car’s type, brand, and model, then returns whether maintenance or spare parts are needed. It simulates a basic diagnostic tool.  
> **Key Features:**  
> - Structured code with functions and file organization  
> - Input validation to guide the user  
> - Problem-solving focused on real-life application

---

### 🔹 Simple Calculator (C++)  
A basic arithmetic calculator capable of handling operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.  
> **Key Features:**  
> - Clean function-based design  
> - Input validation for numeric operations  
> - Interactive experience via console
